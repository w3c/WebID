Abstract
--------
WebID 1.0
Web Identification and Discovery

Identification and privacy have been at the center of how we interact
with sites on the Web. The explosion of Websites over the last decade
and a half has created a point of pain for anyone that uses the Web on a
regular basis. Remembering login details, passwords, and sharing private
information across the many websites that people use on a daily basis
has become more difficult and complicated than necessary. This
specification outlines a simple universal identification mechanism that
is distributed, openly extensible, improves privacy, security and
control over how one can identify themselves and control access to their
information on the Web.
