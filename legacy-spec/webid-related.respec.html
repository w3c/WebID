<p>Social networking, identity and privacy have been at the center of how we 
interact with the Web in the last decade. The explosion of social networking 
sites has brought the world closer together as well as created new points of
pain regarding ease of use and the Web. Remembering login details, passwords,
and sharing private information across the many websites and social groups
that we are a part of has become more difficult and complicated than necessary. 
The Social Web is designed to ensure that control of identity and privacy 
settings is always simple and under one's control. WebID is a key enabler of the 
Social Web. This specification outlines a simple universal identification 
mechanism that is distributed, openly extensible, improves privacy, security 
and control over how one can identify themselves and control access to their 
information on the Web.

<h2>How to Read this Document</h2>
  
<p>There are a number of concepts that are covered in this document that the
reader may want to be aware of before continuing. General knowledge of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">public key cryptography</a> 
and RDF [[!RDF-PRIMER]] and RDFa [[!RDFA-CORE]] is necessary to understand how 
to implement this specification. WebID uses a number of specific technologies 
like HTTP over TLS [[!HTTP-TLS]], X.509 certificates [[!X509V3]], 
RDF/XML [[!RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]] and XHTML+RDFa [[!XHTML-RDFA]].</p>

<p>A general <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> is provided for all that
would like to understand why this specification is necessary to simplify usage
of the Web.</p>

<p>The terms used throughout this specification are listed in the section
titled <a href="#terminology">Terminology</a>.</p>

<p>Developers that are interested in implementing this specification will be
most interested in the sections titled

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The WebID specification is designed to help alleviate the difficultly that
remembering different logins, passwords and settings for websites has created. 
It is also designed to provide a universal and extensible mechanism to express 
public and private information about yourself. This section outlines the 
motivation behind the specification and the relationship to other similar 
specifications that are in active use today.
</p>

<section class='informative'>
<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p class='issue'>TODO</p>

<section class='informative'>
<h1>Relation to OpenID</h1>

<p class='issue'>This section needs to be re-written. The flow and grammar
leaves much to be desired. -- manu</p>

<p>WebID is compatible with OpenID. Both protocols use a URI that dereferences
to a Personal Profile Document. This Personal Profile Document is where further
information about an identity can be discovered. This mechanism is compatible
with both WebID and OpenID. Therefore, WebID does not intend to replace OpenID, 
but can work beside OpenID by sharing the content in the Personal Profile
Document.</p>

<p>That said, there are a number of benefits that WebID achieves over OpenID:
</p>

<p>WebID gives people and other agents a WebID URI for identification. OpenID
also provides a URI to a Personal Profile Document. However, in the case of
WebID, one does not need to remember the URI since the User Agent remembers
the URI on behalf of the person browsing. To log in on a WebID web site there
is no need to enter any identifier like one has to do for OpenID. Just one click 
tells the browser to send the WebID URI. The person that is browsing does
not need to remember either their WebID URI or the website password, and because
no password or other secret credential is exchanged with the website, WebID is
immune from phishing attacks.
</p>

<p>
While WebID works well in a browser environment, it is also very useful outside
of the browser environment. WebID can also operate without requiring the use
of any passwords. This is useful to developers that may 
want to use WebID to perform server-to-server or peer-to-peer verification of 
identity. WebID works for automated agents such as Search Agents, API Agents,
and other automated mechanisms that are often found outside of the browser
environment.
</p>

<p>The WebID protocol requires just one direct network connection to establish
identity via the client. The server requires one connection to the client and
one connection to retrieve the WebID Profile if it does not have the credential
information cached. Compare this to the much more complex OpenID sequence, which
requires six connections by the client to establish a login. In a world of 
distributed data where each site can point to data on any other site, multiple 
connections become costly to manage.</p>

<p>WebID builds on a number of well established Internet and Web standards;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a>, 
RDF [[RDF-PRIMER]], RDFa [[!RDFA-CORE]], RDF/XML [[!RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]], 
TLS [[!HTTP-TLS]], and X.509 [[!X509V3]]. By building on proven technologies
which have been integrated into Web browsers for many years,
it makes both explaining and implementing WebID easier on developers.
As a matter of fact, there were already three interoperable implementations
of WebID before this specification was written.</p>

<p>Since WebID is RESTful, you can perform basic HTTP operations to 
<code>GET</code> your WebID, and if you needed update it, you can use
HTTP <code>PUT</code> semantics. You can also create a WebID via 
<code>POST</code>. This is improved from the OpenID specification, which
requires a new set of operations described in the OpenID Attribute Exchange
specification.</p>

<p>WebID is built on RDF and thus enables all of the advanced semantic web
concepts that RDF enables. For example, a developer may perform machine
reasoning with a WebID. One can construct machine-executable statements like
"If this WebID claims to be a friend of one of our partner WebIDs that is
trusted and the relationship is bi-directional, trust the WebID." 
While OpenID attempts to support this use case by mapping OpenID to RDF, it's
far easier to do with WebID because WebID is natively built on RDF. This also
allows to include WebID profiles into HTML documents with RDFa.</p>

<p>It is easy to extend a WebID with new attributes via RDF. The power of
RDF allows developers to add extensions to WebID by defining new
vocabularies that they publish. There is no authorization process necessary
and thus WebID allows for distributed innovation. Every WebID property is
a URI, which when clicked, can give you yet more information about what the
property means. A developer can create new usage classes by extending their
vocabulary at will. A developer can add relationships to a WebID by simply
adding more HTML to the developer's page. OpenID does not provide any type of
distributed innovation akin to RDF.</p>

<p>WebID is truly decentralized - with WebID you get a web of trust. 
OpenID only supports the Web of Trust model if you indirectly trust the
OpenID provider. In other words - OpenID is not truly decentralized. In OpenID
you must trust OpenID providers. With WebID you only have to trust the people
and the organizations with which you are communicating. In other words, you
don't have to ask anyone whether or not you can trust your friends. You can
query people that you trust directly to see if someone is trustworthy or not.
There is no need for a central WebID authority.
</p>

<p>WebID is fully distributed. Anyone can setup a WebID by placing a single
file on a web server of their choosing, for example on their own domain name.
There is no need for a special OpenID-like provider service.
You can also use a WebID hosting provider, but it's not necessary for
WebID to work. While it is possible to run an OpenID server, other
OpenID applications may not trust you and thus you won't be able to fully
utilize your private OpenID credentials. The reason that there are a few
large OpenID providers and very few small OpenID providers is because of this
trust design issue related to OpenID.</p>

<p>WebID does not require HTTP redirects. Redirects are problematic on many
cell phones because telecommunication companies rely heavily on proxy servers which may selectively block
redirects.</p>

<p>A WebID provider is 100% compatible with an OpenID provider and thus can 
inter-operate with OpenID-powered networks.</p>

<p class='issue'>This last claim needs to be backed up by some bug reports or
documentation on the actual problems.</p>

<h1>Relation to OAuth</h1>

<p>
OAuth and WebID are mutually beneficial when used together. WebID can be
used to provide RSA parameters to the RSA-SHA1 signature method required by
OAuth 1.0. WebID can also be used to establish the consumer_key and HTTPS 
connection that will be used to transmit OAuth Tokens in OAuth 2.0.
