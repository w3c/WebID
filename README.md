This repository contains the source code of the [W3C WebID Community
Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webid/) (CG) processes and work items.

## Participation

All substantive contributors to work items must be members of the WebID CG.
It’s easy to [join the CG](https://www.w3.org/community/webid/join) if you’d
like to contribute. Guests are welcome but do not have voting rights.

## Contributing

See the [contributing
guide](https://github.com/w3c/WebID/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed
instructions on how to get started with our project.

The work items are written using
[Bikeshed](https://speced.github.io/bikeshed/), a preprocessor that automates a
lot of modern spec-writing. 
[BUILD.md](https://github.com/w3c/WebID/blob/main/BUILD.md) contains a short
guide on its usage.
